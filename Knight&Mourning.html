        <h2 id="Section1">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The game is a 2d platformer where players must reach the exit of a level before the timer runs out.
           <a href="Knight.html">The Knight</a> can walk, run, swim, jump, and walljump.<br>
           Each level has collectible tokens, and might have multiple exits. Oh, and the game is meant to be difficult and rage inducing. <br>
            There is also gamer mode, which is a perma-death mode.</p>
