        <h2 id="Section0">Conception</h2>
        <p>Knight & Mourning was concieved after 1actose failed to learn how to make 3ds homebrew, and then turned to PC game development.<br>
        The concept of the game came to him while he was looking at speedrunning categoires. The game went into development on the 25th of January, 2022.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="Section1">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The game is a 2d platformer where players must reach the exit of a level before the timer runs out.
           <a href="Knight.html">The Knight</a> can walk, run, swim, jump, and walljump.<br>
           Each level has collectible tokens, and might have multiple exits. Oh, and the game is meant to be difficult and rage inducing. <br>
            There is also gamer mode, which is a perma-death mode.</p>
