        <p>The Skeleton Knight is a costume that allows you to play as the death sprite. It is unlocked after the player has died 1,000 times.<br>
        The costume makes the player invulnerable to spikes.</p>
        <h3 id="Section3">Chill Knight</h3>
        <img class="TinyPic" src="idle.png" alt="Chill Knight">
        <p>The Chill Knight is a simple colour swap of the Knight, with the greys being replaced with blue, and the red being replaced with green.<br>
            It was made by me, and is based of Cirno from Touhou Project.</p>
